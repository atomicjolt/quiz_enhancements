# QuizEnhancements

## Installation

Clone this repo into canvas at `gems/plugin/quiz_enhancements`. Then run
`bundle install` at the root of canvas, then start canvas.

## Usage

Canvas plugins allow injecting ruby code into Canvas. It's not really
documented, so most of the strategy has been adapted from the [Instucture
analytics project](https://github.com/instructure/analytics).
